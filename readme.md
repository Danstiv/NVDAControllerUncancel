# NVDA Controller Uncancel

Prevents speech interruption for programs using the nvdaController library.

Some programs (particularly games like STW) use the nvdaController library to interact with NVDA, and one of the library's functions is speech interruption.

Sometimes it is useful, however, some developers abuse its use, which reduces the convenience when working with the product, and with the whole NVDA.

This addon solves this problem, preventing speech interruption by means of nvdaController.

The addon does not need to be configured, nor does it have its own gestures (hot keys).

Simply install it and it will start working.
